    ### Tenovos Rights Management (RM)
    #### Tenovos Rights Management is organized into Agreements, Rights, Entities, and Projects.  

  #### **Agreements**: are the starting point for all rights.  An Agreement must have one or more parties that grant the rights (grantors).  Agreements must have a name and are comprised of individual rights which must have a term (start and end date), territories (allowed or denied), and media channels or other distributions.
  #### **Rights**: are defined within an Agreement.  Each right defines a specific set of terms and permitted uses - the most common being 'exhibition' rights across a variety of media and distribution channels.  Another common right is 'identification', which clears talent, 3rd party IP, such as brands, and other items to appear in the works being distributed or used.
  #### **Entities**: are people and organizations with various roles.  In the context of a rights agreement, they may be the grantor and grantee parties to an agreement.  Examples of entities are photographers, musicians, actors, and models.
  #### **Assets**: are any media asset such as photography, images, video, voiceover, music tracks, etc.
  #### **Projects**: are containers that serve to make it easy to associate assets with rights and entities.  A project may also have other dimensions such as information about photo shoots, budget, marketing campaigns, etc.
