# V1.5 Overview

## Tenovos API Reference

The Tenovos API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).  Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies,
returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
